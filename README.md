# proto-top-k-early-termination
Early Termination Top-K prototype

The goal of the projet is to make a prototype inspired by the sage engine to build and try our algorithm on a benchmark.

The algorithm has the particularity to use early termination on top-k request to optimise the time need to complete top-k request.
